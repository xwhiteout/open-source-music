# OSM, the Open Source Music project

Have you ever wanted to participate in the creation of a song of a weird genre? Experiment with a band with no strings attached?
OSM is an open source project meant to breed creativity with a focus on community.

## How it works

### Start fresh

In OSM you can start a song from scratch by simply copying the [song template](./templates/song/README.md) folder and filling it with your own material. We will only ask of you to try to stick to the [collaboration rules](#collaboration-rules) so the repository can be maintained in order.

### Collaborate

You can also browse through the existing songs repertoire in the [music](music) directory and have a go to any of them. To do so, yo will have to create a `feature/` branch and request a pull to the song creator, more information below.

### Do feature requests

Finally, by use of the [Issues](https://github.com/xwhiteout/open-source-music/issues) tab you can request song ideas, features, or any piece of music that can help you bring you closer to having a finished song.

# OSM: Open Source Music

Have you ever wanted to participate in a song of a weird genre? Experiment with a band no strings attached?

OSM is an open source project meant to breed creativity with a focus on community.

## How it works

### Start fresh

In OSM you can start a song from scratch by simply copying the [song template](./templates/song/README.md), filling it with your own material and uploading it to [music](/music). We will only ask you to stick to the [collaboration rules](#collaboration-rules) so the repository can be maintained in order.

### Collaborate

Browse through the existing songs repertoire in the [music](music) directory and have a go to any of them. To do so, yo will have to create a `feature/` branch and request a pull to the _song starter_, more information below.

### Do feature requests

Finally, use the [issues](https://github.com/xwhiteout/open-source-music/issues) tab to request song ideas, features, or anything to add to the project.
